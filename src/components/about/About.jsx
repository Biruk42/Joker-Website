        Forever alone in a crowd, failed comedian Arthur Fleck seeks connection
        as he walks the streets of Gotham City. Arthur wears two masks -- the
        one he paints for his day job as a clown, and the guise he projects in a
        futile attempt to feel like he's part of the world around him. Isolated,
        bullied and disregarded by society, Fleck begins a slow descent into
        madness as he transforms into the criminal mastermind known as the
        Joker.
